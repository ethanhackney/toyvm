commands (3 bits)
=================
halt:   halt virtual machine
add:    add two registers together
mult:   multiply two registers
div:    divide two registers
mov:    see 'transfer type'

registers (3 bits) all are general purpose
==========================================
r0
r1
r2
r3
r4
r5
r6

transfer type (2 bits)
======================
register to register
register to memory
memory to register
memory to memory

instruction format
==================

first 3 bits are the command
[ 0 ][ 0 ][ 0 ]

next 3 bits are the transfer type
[ 0 ][ 0 ][ 0 ] [ 0 ][ 0 ]

next 3 bits can signify multiple things:

        if the transfer type is register to register:
                the next 3 bits are the destination register
                the next 3 bits of the next word are the source register
        if the transfer type is register to memory:
                the next 3 bits are the source register
                the next 4 words are the complete memory address to put register value at
        if the transfer type is memory to register:
                the next 3 bits are the destination register:
                the next 4 words the the complete memory address to load register with
        if the transfer type is memory to memory:
                the next 4 words the the complete memory address to load
